# Udacity Project - MWS Restaurant Stage 1

This project focuses on various aspects of frontend development including responsive design, support for screen readers and use of service workers.

The rubric for the project is located here:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
